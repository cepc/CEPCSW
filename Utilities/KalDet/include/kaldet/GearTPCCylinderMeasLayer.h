  /** Implements the sorting policy.
   *  The layers are first sorted by radius + offset. This offset is only
   *  useful for segments of a cylinder, like the LP1.
   *  As offsets in this case can be positive or negative, but only make sense in one 
   *  direction (you need a continuous number), we only allow offsets in x.
   *  This should not be too much of a problem, you should be able to rotate your coordinates
   *  so the offset is in x. If not you have to extend the sorting policy. (Please thake
   *  care not to reduce versatility when doing so. You might want to implement your own class?)
   *  
   *  For equal radii  + offset the layers are sorted by moduleID. As we have to squeeze this 
   *  information into only one number, we multiply the radius + offset by 1e9 and add the moduleID.
   *  A double has a precision of 53 bits, which is 15.9 digits. So the radius can be up to 1e6.9 mm
   *  without causing the last digit of the the ModuleID to be cut, and for up to 1000 modules the
   *  layers can be distinguished down to 1 nm without the two numbers mixing, or down to 1 micron
   *  with up to 1.000.000 modules.
   * 
   *  The additional sorting by module is intended for cylinder segments. Here only one module/row
   *  per layer is allowed, so we just take the first entry in the set. In case of a perfect layer
   *  it does not matter because there should only be one layer at this radius, so the sort order
   *  should not be affected by adding an arbitrary module ID (as long as the module ID is < 1e6, as 
   *  described above).
