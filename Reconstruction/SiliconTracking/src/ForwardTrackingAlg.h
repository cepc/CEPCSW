 * 
 * @param FTDHitCollections The collections containing the FTD hits <br>
 * (default value "FTDTrackerHits FTDSpacePoints" (string vector) )
 * 
 * @param ForwardTrackCollection Name of the Forward Tracking output collection<br>
 * (default value  "ForwardTracks" )
 * 
 * @param MultipleScatteringOn Whether to take multiple scattering into account when fitting the tracks<br>
 * (default value true )
 * 
 * @param EnergyLossOn Whether to take energy loss into account when fitting the tracks<br>
 * (default value true )
 * 
 * @param SmoothOn Whether to smooth all measurement sites in fit<br>

 * 
 * @param HitsPerTrackMin The minimum number of hits to create a track<br>
 * (default value 3 )
 * 
 * @param BestSubsetFinder The method used to find the best non overlapping subset of tracks. Available are: SubsetHopfieldNN, SubsetSimple and None.
 * None means, that no final search for the best subset is done and overlapping tracks are possible. <br>
 * (default value TrackSubsetHopfieldNN )
 * 
 * @param Criteria A vector of the criteria that are going to be used by the Cellular Automaton. <br>
 * For every criterion a min and max needs to be set!!!<br>
 * (default value is defined in class Criteria )
 * 
 * @param NameOfACriterion_min/max For every used criterion a minimum and maximum value needs to be set. <br>
 * If a criterion is named "Crit_Example", then the min parameter would be: Crit_Example_min and the max parameter Crit_Example_max.<br>
 * You can enter more than one value!!! So for example you could write something like \<parameter name="Crit_Example_min" type="float">30 0.8\</parameter>.<br>
 * This means, that if the Cellular Automaton creates too many connections (how many is defined in "MaxConnectionsAutomaton" ) it reruns
 * it with the next set of parameters. Thus allowing to tighten the cuts, if there are too many connections and so preventing 
 * it from getting stuck in very bad combinatorial situations. So in this example the Automaton will first run with the Crit_Example_min of 30
 * and if that generates too many connections, it will rerun it with the value 0.8.<br>
 * If for a criterion no further parameters are specified, the first ones will be taken on reruns.
 * 
 * @param MaxConnectionsAutomaton If the automaton has more connections than this it will be redone with the next cut off values for the criteria.<br>
 * If there are no further new values for the criteria, the event will be skipped.<br>
 * (default value 100000 )
 * 
 * @param MaxHitsPerSector If on any single sector there are more hits than this, all the hits in the sector get dropped.
 * This is to prevent combinatorial breakdown (It is a second safety mechanism, the first one being MaxConnectionsAutomaton.
 * But if there are soooo many hits, that already the first round of the Cellular Automaton would take forever, this mechanism
 * prevents it) <br>
 * (default value 1000)

   * 
   *  The basic procedure for reconstruction of tracks in the FTD is as follows:
   *      
   *    -# Read in all collections of hits on the FTD that are passed as steering parameters
   *    -# From every hit in these collections an FTDHit01 is created. This is, because the SegmentBuilder and the Automaton
   * need their own hit classes.
   *    -# The hits are stored in the map _map_sector_hits. The keys in this map are the sectors and the values of the map are vectors
   * of the hits within those sectors. Sector here means an integer somehow representing a place in the detector.
   * (For using this numbers and getting things like layer or side the class SectorSystemFTD is used.)
   *    -# Make a safety check to ensure no single sector is overflowing with hits. This could give a combinatorial
   * disaster leading to endless calculation times.
   *    -# Add a virtual hit in the place of the IP. It is used by the Cellular Automaton as additional information
   * (almost all reconstructable tracks come from a vertex roughly around the IP)
   *    -# Look for hits on overlapping petals. If two petals from the FTD overlap, a track may pass through both and thus
   * create two hits in close range. For pattern recognition as it is now, they are not useful. (Imagine you try to
   * guess the radius of the helix formed by a track and you have 3 hits. If these 3 hits are sensibly spaced, this is
   * no problem. But now imagine, that two of them are very close. Just a small deviation in the relative position
   * of those two would give entirely different results.) Such short connections are therefore looked for and stored, but
   * are not dealt with until later the track candidates are found.
   *    -# The SegmentBuilder takes the hits and a vector of criteria.These criteria tell the SegmentBuilder when two
   * hits might be part of a possible track. (For example, when we look for stiff tracks, we can form a line from one hit
   * to the other and demand that this line will come close to the IP. )  
   * The SegmentBuilder as the name suggests builds segments from the hits. A Segment is essentially a part of a track.
   * For now a segment consists of a single hit. BUT: in contrast to a hit it knows all other segments it is 
   * connected to. Lets take an easy example: A track crosses layer 2,3,4 and 5 creating hits A,B,C and D. 
   * Then, if the track is not very ugly (huge multiple sacttering or energy loss ) the SegmentBuilder will create 
   * corresponding segments A,B,C and D. D is connected with C. C with B, B with A and A with the IP. 
   * So in these connections the true track is already contained. 
   * For real situations we have of course many more hits and many more tracks and background and so on. So the connections
   * are plenty and if we took every possible track we could create from them, we would kill the system.
   * Therefore we use the Cellular Automaton to get rid of as much as possible.
   *    -# The Cellular Automaton: As a result from the SegmentBuilder we get an Automaton object. It has all the segments
   * the SegmentBuilder created and from us it gets some criteria to work with. (These Criteria again tell us when a
   * connection makes sense and when it doesn't. Only the connections now get longer and involve first 3 hits and then 4).
   * It first builds longer segments (now containing 2 hits instead of 1). These longer segments are again connected with
   * each other (connections are made if the criteria allow it). The Automaton then looks for connections that go all 
   * the way through to the innermost layer (the IP). Segments not connected all the way through to the IP get deleted.
   * It might be a good idea to look into <a href="../CellularAutomaton.pdf">Introduction to the Cellular Automaton</a>
   * for more details on the Cellular Automaton. The summary is, that with every step and every criterion the CA is able
   * to sort out combinatorial background until at the end we extract track candidates from it.
   *    -# Next we iterate over every trackcandidate we got.
   *    -# The hits from overlapping petals are added and every possible combination of the trackcandidate and the hits
   * we could add is created. The best version is then taken (if this is switched on in the steering parameters).
   *    -# Cuts: First we do a helix fit. If the result (chi2 / Ndf ) is too bad the track is dropped. Then we do a 
   * Kalman Fit. Also if the results here (chi squared probability) are bad the track is not saved.
   *    -# Find the best subset: the tracks we now gathered may not be all compatible with each other (i.e. share hits).
   * This situation is resolved with a best subset finder like the Hopfield Neural Network.
   *    -# Now the tracks are all compatible and suited our different criteria. It is time to save them. At the end they
   * get finalised and stored in the output collection.
