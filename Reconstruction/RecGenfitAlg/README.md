# RecGenfitAlg package

This package is the track fitting algorithms to do track fitting with genfit.
It's incudingg the interface to genfit fitter, track and measurement:
* GenfitAlg: The algorithm for drift chamber fitting with genfit
* GenfitFitter: fitter implementation
* GenfitTrack: class for create and access of genfit Track and Measurement
* GenfitField: implementation of genfit AbsField
* GenfitGeoMaterialInterface: implementation of genfit AbsMaterialInterface
* GenfitAlgDC: a class to fit drift chamber
* GenfitAlgSDT: a class to fit drift chamber+silicon
